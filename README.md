# Planar-Data-Classification-with-One-Hidden-Layer

# The Model Comprises of: 

Visualising the dataset using matplotlib. The data looks like a "flower" with some red (label y=0) and some blue (y=1) points. Number of training examples is 400. The goal is to build a model to fit this data. The Dataset contains a numpy-array (matrix) X that contains the features (x1, x2) and a numpy-array (vector) Y that contains your labels (red:0, blue:1). The size of hidden layer is 4.

# Result :

1. The Neural Network model with one hidden layer has learnt the leaf patterns of the flower!

2. Accuracy is 90%
